# LegalX - A C# Project
This project was done as a part of my exam for my programming course at my university.

## Technical concepts
This program has a hardcoded database in which the users of the program can interact with. The project incorporates different concepts within object-oriented programming. The concepts and methods that are used are: inheritance, classes, interfaces, abstract methods, objects, try-catch statements, input validation and more.

## Usability
This program is a program created for a legal company to use. The program allows the employee to login to the program which will display a list of functions that they can utilize. The program allows employees to view existing cases, clients and appointments present in the database, as well as allow the user to add new ones with their own input.
