# LegalX - A C# Project
This project was done as a part of my exam for my programming course at my university.

## Objective of exam assignment
Create a functioning program for a company named LegalX that provide legal services to its clients. The company has different employees who each should have their own login for the program. After successful login, the program should present a list of choices that they are presented with according to their occupation.
The requirements of the exam assignment were to build appropriate classes for the different entities, use Object Oriented Programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces/abstract classes, as well as exception handling and input validation.

## Technical concepts
This program has a hardcoded database in which the users of the program can interact with. The project incorporates different concepts within Object Oriented Programming. The concepts and methods that are used are: inheritance, classes, interfaces, abstract methods, objects, try-catch statements, input validation and more.

## Usability
This program is a program created for a legal company to use. The program allows the employee to login to the program which will display a list of functions that they can utilize. The program allows employees to view existing cases, clients and appointments present in the database, as well as allow the user to add new ones with their own input.
